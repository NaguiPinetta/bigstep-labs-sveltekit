# Project Review: Achievements as of 6.6.25

## 1. Authentication & User Management

- Magic link login via Supabase Auth (email-based, with a whitelist for allowed emails).
- Multi-user support: each user has their own data, enforced by Row Level Security (RLS).
- Dynamic sidebar/footer showing the real logged-in user (name, email, avatar).
- Working logout functionality.

## 2. Database & Data Model

- Supabase Postgres database with tables for:
  - **models** (LLM model profiles)
  - **api_keys** (per-provider API keys)
  - **chat_sessions** (chat session metadata)
  - **messages** (individual chat messages)
- All tables have a `user_id` column and proper foreign key relationships.
- RLS enabled and (optionally) policies to ensure users only access their own data.

## 3. UI/UX

- Modern, responsive SvelteKit app using SHADCN UI components.
- Sidebar navigation with:
  - Agent (Chat, History, Starred, Settings)
  - Documentation
  - Settings
  - Model Profiles
  - Log out
- User menu with account actions (profile, billing, notifications, logout).
- Clean, consistent design with proper alignment and accessibility.

## 4. Features

- Chat interface connected to OpenAI (or other LLM) via API key.
- Model selection and management (with custom prompts).
- Settings page for managing multiple API keys (CRUD).
- Documentation page rendering static Markdown.
- Error handling for auth, navigation, and API issues.

## 5. Developer Experience

- Modular, maintainable SvelteKit codebase.
- Use of Svelte stores for global state (user, models, etc.).
- Clear separation of UI, logic, and data.
- Supabase CLI/SQL integration for schema management.

# Troubleshooting & Lessons Learned (June 2024)

## Row Level Security (RLS) & Supabase Policies

- RLS must be enabled on all user data tables (e.g., `models`).
- Policies like `user_id = auth.uid()` restrict access to only the user's own data.
- When using the Supabase dashboard or SQL editor, you have full access (service role), so queries always work.
- When using the Supabase client in your app/backend, RLS applies and only allows access if the user's JWT is present and valid.
- If your backend uses only the anon key (no JWT), `auth.uid()` is null and RLS policies will block access.
- A permissive policy like `USING (true)` will allow all reads, but is not secure for production.
- Always test RLS policies with the actual client context (with JWT) to ensure users can only access their own data.

## Debugging Steps

- If your app cannot read user data but the SQL editor can, check RLS and policies first.
- Add logging to your backend to see what IDs and data are being sent/received.
- Temporarily use a permissive policy to isolate RLS issues, then revert to secure policies.
- Ensure your backend passes the user's JWT to Supabase for all authenticated requests.

## Next Steps for Security

- Update backend logic to use the user's JWT/session when querying Supabase.
- Remove permissive policies and use secure, user-scoped RLS policies.
- Regularly review and test RLS as you add new features or tables.
